# Celestial Code Chronicles 🌟🎄

Welcome to the Celestial Code Chronicles repository! This is where I, Celeste, embark on the Advent of Code challenge, blending the magic of Christmas with the wonders of the astral realm.

## 🎁 About the Project

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that takes place during the month of December. Each day leading up to Christmas, a new programming puzzle is released, testing participants' problem-solving skills and coding prowess. In this repository, I'll be sharing my solutions and approaches to these challenges, aiming to spread some holiday cheer and celestial inspiration.
