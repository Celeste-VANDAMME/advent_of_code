# Céleste VANDAMME - Advent of Code


## Introduction
Welcome to my repository!\
Here you'll find my programs I coded for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

As for a brief introduction:

> I am a professional Data Engineer with `+4 years of experience`.

> I've always been passioned about the IT world. \
> I love discovering and mastering new video games: I've been [speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/fr-FR/users/Slaker) since 2023 too!


## What is the Advent of Code adventure?
> _Advent of Code_  is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

> You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

> *Eric Wastl, **AdventOfCode.com** (2024)*
